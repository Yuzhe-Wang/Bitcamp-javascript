## **Bitcamp-javascript**

Learn about the versatility and power of the Javascript programming language, with a developer advocate from Twilio!

**Why Learn Javascript?**

Javascript is one of the most consistently requested languages to learn from students and new engineers, and it's no surprise. Javascript is commonly used for both frontend and backend operations, with dozens of popular, powerful libraries at its disposal.

Twilio specifically is one of the leading sources for everything communications on the web. From their site:

- Connect with customers everywhere they want to interact with you—from text messages to emails, phone calls to video, intelligent chatbots and back—within a single powerful platform.

Learning Javascript gives you the ability to interact with all sorts of online tools pre-built for you, just like Twilio!

**What will the student work on?**

Students will quest online together through Space! The [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest/learn/javascript) modules online are excellent resources that you can follow along with during our weekly live sessions and ask questions of our experienced staff.

Between live streams, there will be original take-home assignments that enforce the learnings from the modules and help you venture into your own future journeys through space and the Javascript universe!

- Work with arrays in more typical, interview-prep way
- Goal: Javascript coverage and learning some of what most developers will know after a year or two of learning\

### **Week 3**

Programs! Building functions that behave appropriately for the prompts that are passed in.

**Objective: *Complete Your Quest***
